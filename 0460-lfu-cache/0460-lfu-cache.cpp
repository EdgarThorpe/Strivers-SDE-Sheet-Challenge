// Intuition of this Problem:
// For get(key) --> gets the value of the key if exists, else -1;

// for put(key, value) -->
// condition 1: updates the value of the key if present, else inserts the key directly.
// condition 2: when cache is full -->
// - case i : if cache is full, removes the LFU guy
// - case ii : if cache is full, but exists multiple LFU guys (or a tie exists), then remove the LRU one and then add new node.

// NOTE - PLEASE READ APPROACH FIRST THEN SEE THE CODE. YOU WILL DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THE CODE LINE BY LINE AFTER SEEING THE APPROACH.

// Approach for this Problem:

// 1. 
// The class LFUCache has three unordered_map data structures:
// keyVal: stores the key-value pairs, with the key as the first element of the pair and the value as the second element.
// freqList: stores the keys in a list, with the key's frequency as the index of the list.
// pos: stores the position of each key in the freqList.

// 2.
// The class also has a private integer variable 'capacity' that is initialized in the constructor and represents the maximum number of key-value pairs that can be stored in the cache.

// 3.
// The get() function is used to retrieve a value from the cache given a key. If the key is not found in the keyVal map, -1 is returned. Otherwise, the following steps are taken:
// The key's current frequency is retrieved from keyVal.
// The key is removed from the list at index equal to its current frequency in the freqList map.
// The key's frequency in keyVal is incremented by 1.
// The key is added to the list at index equal to its new frequency in the freqList map.
// The key's position in the freqList map is updated in the pos map.
// If the list at index equal to the current minimum frequency is empty, the minimum frequency is incremented by 1.
// The value associated with the key is returned.

// 4.
// The put() function is used to add a new key-value pair to the cache or update the value of an existing key.
// If the capacity is 0, the function returns immediately.
// If the key already exists in the keyVal map, the following steps are taken:
// The key's value is updated in the keyVal map.
// The key is removed from the list at index equal to its current frequency in the freqList map.
// The key's frequency in keyVal is incremented by 1.
// The key is added to the list at index equal to its new frequency in the freqList map.
// The key's position in the freqList map is updated in the pos map.
// If the list at index equal to the current minimum frequency is empty, the minimum frequency is incremented by 1.
// If the key does not already exist in the keyVal map and the size of keyVal is equal to the capacity, the following steps are taken:
// The key at the front of the list at index equal to the current minimum frequency in the freqList map is removed from all three maps (keyVal, freqList, pos).
// A new key-value pair is added to keyVal, with a frequency of 1.
// The key is added to the list at index 1 in the freqList map.The key's position in the freqList map is updated in the pos map.
// The minimum frequency is set to 1.
